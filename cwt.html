              As readers approach the action and dialogue of this wide-ranging narrative, they might consider their reaction to a talking tree suddenly engaging them in
              conversation. And this is not the
              typical
              talking tree. Other humans cannot see or hear its verbal and non-verbal communication with you. The tree knows everything about you and your history. Tree knows what you are thinking as your thoughts emerge. In fact, the tree seems to
              know
              everything about everything. Are you insane or are you about to embark on a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity?</p>

            <ul class="list-unstyled cwt-inner">
              <li>I knew that insanity did not run in my family. We had our share of problems and eccentricities, but no one had, to my knowledge, married either royalty or a cousin. No one was known to have had
                unusual relationships with trees.
                <br> On the other hand, I wasn’t particularly well read in psychology or psychiatry, to my credit, I thought. What if there is a known and well-researched type of insanity involving men who, later in life, meet the equivalent of
                the
                invisible friend from childhood. What if I am another case study, first blooming? It probably has a name already, so that it won’t be the “Brookshire syndrome.” (No big deal, but I would have liked some credit for it.)
              </li>
              <li>
                Perhaps the talking tree was the tip of the iceberg for me, and my insanity was real and would now progress rapidly. What was the progression: a talking tree, a singing dog, a laughing airplane? (I glanced at the dog but she
                wasn’t
                singing. Good.) How far would it go? And if I were insane, then, by definition it seemed, none of these things would be extraordinary to me, beginning with the talking tree. They would only seem unusual to the people who took me
                away, locked me up, and talked to me in soft voices.
