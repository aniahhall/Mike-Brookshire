                Mike, in his internal debate over insanity versus opportunity, resorted to a previously-used tactic from antiquity. </p>

              <ul class="list-unstyled cwt-inner">
                <li>Deliberately looking at the tree’s head, I thought to him, “Mr. Tree… I don’t exactly know how to address you. But if you are real and you have been listening to what I have been thinking, then you would understand why I need to
                  ask
                  you for a one-time favor to me, so that I will know this is real and not insanity.”
                  Silence from the tree.
                  <br />
                  “I was just wondering if, perhaps, you could show me a miracle: you know, something that could not be explained in human terms, that could not be done by a human, even the best and the brightest of us.” Still there was silence from
                  the tree, but I somehow felt he was listening and took license to talk further.
                  “It’s not that I’m asking that you do something of benefit to me directly. If you could just wiggle your branches, or raise the couch a foot off the floor, or make the dog dance on her hind legs…”

                  Silence.

                  <br>
                  Then, “Does it occur to you that one of your family inside the house or anyone walking by on the street might see this miracle… and that this might end any chance of future conversations?”
                  “And have you considered,” said the tree, “that if conversations with a backyard tree are the cause of your insanity issue, then miracles that you perceive as performed by the very same tree are not likely to solve your problem?”
                  Actually, I was thinking that very thought but, unfortunately, I had taken the tree’s participation in the conversation as encouragement to keep talking, “Yes, but a miracle or two would make a difference for me, I think. You could
                  do
                  something there in the side yard, just for example, so that only I could see it. Those bushes bordering the yard before the treeline, maybe they could move, or dance, or sing, or something. Or, the groundhog and rabbits and deer who
                  walk in that yard could make an appearance and do something… or clowns and a marching band… I don’t really know… anything you could do?”
                  “No,” said the tree. “That’s ridiculous. I’m not showing you a miracle.” And that was the last time the tree and I talked about miracles for a while.

              <h2>Insanity</h2>
              <h3>October 1st, 2022</h3>
              <p>
                As readers approach the action and dialogue of this wide-ranging narrative, they might consider their reaction to a talking tree suddenly engaging them in
                conversation. And this is not the
                typical
                talking tree. Other humans cannot see or hear its verbal and non-verbal communication with you. The tree knows everything about you and your history. Tree knows what you are thinking as your thoughts emerge. In fact, the tree seems to
                know
                everything about everything. Are you insane or are you about to embark on a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity?</p>
              <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-plus"></i>
            </a>
            <div id="demo1" class="collapse">
              <ul class="list-unstyled cwt-inner">
                <li>I knew that insanity did not run in my family. We had our share of problems and eccentricities, but no one had, to my knowledge, married either royalty or a cousin. No one was known to have had unusual relationships with trees.
                  <br> On the other hand, I wasn’t particularly well read in psychology or psychiatry, to my credit, I thought. What if there is a known and well-researched type of insanity involving men who, later in life, meet the equivalent of
                  the
                  invisible friend from childhood. What if I am another case study, first blooming? It probably has a name already, so that it won’t be the “Brookshire syndrome.” (No big deal, but I would have liked some credit for it.)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Perhaps the talking tree was the tip of the iceberg for me, and my insanity was real and would now progress rapidly. What was the progression: a talking tree, a singing dog, a laughing airplane? (I glanced at the dog but she
                  wasn’t
                  singing. Good.) How far would it go? And if I were insane, then, by definition it seemed, none of these things would be extraordinary to me, beginning with the talking tree. They would only seem unusual to the people who took me
                  away, locked me up, and talked to me in soft voices.
